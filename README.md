Hi, I’m @CesarE-9. I am a Systems/Software Engineer.

I work in the Public Safety environment, designing, developing and deploying a CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) system to 911 call centers.
One of my tasks is to discover, asses, research and address any software vulnerabilities in our systems. Since we use Node.js and a plethora of packages and their dependencies, this can often be a daunting task.
